### ProfitStreams

Alas, ProfitStreams is no longer in business, the LinkedIn URL is [here][ProfitStreams]{:target="_blank"}. As Senior Software Developer at ProfitStreams I built web applications for the hospitality industry, with a focus on development of an Online Ordering application for restaurants. The technology was Rails 2.3.5 (with a migration plan in place to Rails 3.1) integrated with a Java-based API (driven by [Talend][Talend]{:target="_blank"}) that merged the application data into a unified backend. Clients could log into one central location to see customer data and set up Twitter and Facebook marketing campaigns, among other things.

### Internet Pawn, Inc, now dba Pawngo

Internet Pawn and Boomerang Lending have merged into [Pawngo][Pawngo]{:target="_blank"}. The previous sites were all Rails 2.3.x The Boomerang Lending site was Rails 2.3.8 using [Refinery CMS][Refinery]{:target="_blank"} for the backend admin services. I did all the Rails development and also wore the DevOps hat.

### Boecore

[Boecore][Boecore]{:target="_blank"} does business as a DoD contractor, and I helped develop BoBCAT - a Rails 2 application for automating and tracking the DIACAP compliance and Information Assurance activities required by the Missile Defense Agency. This was a classified project.
