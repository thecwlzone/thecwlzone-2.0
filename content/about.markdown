## Professional Ramblings
I haven't always been a web developer. <a href="#" class="text_toggle" onclick="toggle_visibility('ramblings_content');">Read More|Less</a>

<div id="ramblings_content" style="display:none">
I've been doing Rails development full time since 2009, and I've been working with the [Ruby][Ruby]{:target="_blank"} language since 2005.

Prior to that, I spent 27 years in the semiconductor industry at various companies such as Ford Microelectronics, [Cypress Semiconductor][Cypress]{:target="_blank"} and [IBM][IBM]{:target="_blank"}. I was a [DevOps][DevOps]{:target="_blank"} before the buzzword was invented: doing a combination of software development and system administration, as well as acting as the local SME for the [Electronic Design Automation][EDA]{:target="_blank"} tools vital for the creation of [VLSI][VLSI] circuits.

My Ford career in the 1980s was great fun. A Motor City exile working for a car company in Colorado - it doesn't get much better than that. We were designing [first generation][Intel8061]{:target="_blank"} automotive electronics during the week and running Mustangs and T-birds in [SCCA][SCCA]{:target="_blank"} Solo II competition on the weekends. Motor Head Nirvana.

But all things come to an end, and when I ran out of interesting things to do at Ford I jumped ship to a VLSI design startup, that went under the following year. The design team was picked up by Cypress, and I spent 14 years at the Colorado Springs Design Center where we designed [static RAMs][RAMs] that generated over $1.5 billion in revenue for the company.

During my Cypress era the [Dot Bomb][DotBomb]{:target="_blank"} crash of 2000 played out, and after dodging more layoffs than I care to remember, my number came up in 2005, and that was the end of the road with Cypress.

The crew that was cut from Cypress represented a huge amount of VLSI expertise, and we persuaded IBM to let us set up a new VLSI design center in Colorado Springs. Yet another semiconductor market pullback ultimately killed that idea, and as an unwilling participant in the IBM 2009 layoffs, I decided it was long past time to stop chasing electrons. Fortunately, I had been hacking on Rails web sites and doing Ruby programming for awhile, so the transition to Rails web developer was a viable "second career" choice. And that's where I am today.![smiley1](/images/other/biggrin.gif)

## About This Site
This is the 2.0 version of my web site.
<a href="#" class="text_toggle" onclick="toggle_visibility('site_content');">Read More|Less</a>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div id="site_content" style="display:none">

I decided to use [nanoc][Nanoc]{:target="_blank"}, a Ruby-based static site generator. I use nanoc to build content, run the content through the nanoc compiler and upload the generated HTML pages to my site's public directory.

I use a number of web tools to create various effects on the site. See the "Generated by" section of the footnotes at the bottom of this page for a complete list.

I have decided to continue to use the [Wordpress][Wordpress] blog tool even though nanoc has some very powerful built-in blogging features. I know Wordpress has a lot of overhead, there are constant updates, it's a favorite hacker target, blah, blah, blah. But it suits my purposes, and I don't want to burn anymore development time on the site right now. Maybe later.

Web site hosting is done by [NearlyFreeSpeech.net][NFSN]{:target="_blank"}. NFSN is a no-frills, DIY metered service web hosting company. I've been with them since 2004. It costs me about $15 a year to run the site, plus another $10 for annual domain registration. It doesn't get any cheaper. The "down side": you get to do everything yourself, so you need to be a combination web developer and sys admin.
