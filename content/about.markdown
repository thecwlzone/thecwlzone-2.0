## Acknowledgements
[Real Men][RealMen]{:target="_blank"} give credit where credit is due. Thanks to:

1. all my professional colleagues, past and present, and who are too numerous to mention. I make it a point to surround myself with people who are smarter than I am, which forces me to go the extra mile.

2. the [nanoc][Nanoc]{:target="_blank"} team for putting together a very nice Ruby-based static site generator. It's been fun. Thanks!

3. the nanoc Wiki which contains a list of [showcased][NanocShowcase]{:target="_blank"} web sites that use nanoc. I am indebted to Professor [Damien Pollet][DamienPollet]{:target="_blank"} for making his code publicly available, which provided me with a starting point towards building a nice looking web site. *Merci Beaucoup!* 

4. my wife De'Lynne is a great photographer, and all the images on the Home page are her creations. I would be lost without you.
