I continue to use Wordpress for my blog, so this is not a good example of nanoc's powerfull capabilities in that area. FYI.

Please don't reuse the style directly, at least not without making *reasonably visible* aesthetic modifications. I've already ripped it off from somebody else as it is. Thanks.
